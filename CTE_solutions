--🔹 LEVEL 1 — CTE Basics
-- Q1. From table employees(emp_id, emp_name, salary) Use a CTE to calculate the average salary, then return employees who earn more than the average.
WITH average_salary AS (
	SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
	FROM employees
	) SELECT emp_id, emp_name FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT avg_salary FROM average_salary);

-- Q2. From table orders(order_id, customer_id, amount) Use a CTE to calculate total order amount per customer, then return customers whose total amount > 50,000.
WITH t AS (
	SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
	FROM orders
	GROUP BY customer_id
	) SELECT customer_id FROM t WHERE total_amount > 50000;

--🔹 LEVEL 2 — CTE + GROUP BY
-- Q3. From table employees(emp_id, dept_id, salary) Use a CTE to calculate average salary per department, then return department IDs where the average salary is greater than 60,000.
WITH cte1 AS (
	SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary_per_dept
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY dept_id
	) SELECT dept_id FROM cte1 WHERE avg_salary_per_dept > 60000;

-- Q4. From table sales(order_date, product_id, amount) Use a CTE to calculate year-wise total sales, then return only the year with the highest total sales.
WITH yearWiseSales AS (
	SELECT order_date, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
	FROM sales
	GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)
	) SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) FROM yearWiseSales WHERE total_sales = (
		SELECT MAX(total_sales) 
		FROM yearWiseSales
		);

--🔹 LEVEL 3 — CTE + JOIN (Interview Core)
-- Q5.
-- Tables:
-- employees(emp_id, emp_name, dept_id)
-- departments(dept_id, dept_name)
-- Use a CTE to prepare department-wise employee count, then join it to return: dept_name, employee_count.
WITH employees_in_dept AS (
	SELECT d.dept_id, d.dept_name, COUNT(e.*) AS employees_count
	FROM department d 
	JOIN employees e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id
	GROUP BY e.dept_id
	) SELECT dept_name, employees_count FROM employees_in_dept;

-- Q6.
-- Tables:
-- orders(order_id, customer_id)
-- payments(payment_id, order_id, amount)
-- Use a CTE to find orders that have payments, then return orders that do NOT exist in that CTE.
WITH orders_with_payments AS (
	SELECT o.order_id
	FROM orders o
	JOIN payments p ON o.order_id = p.order_id
	) SELECT order_id FROM orders WHERE order_id <> (SELECT order_id FROM orders_with_payments);
	

--🔹 LEVEL 4 — CTE + Window Functions
-- Q7.
-- From table employees(emp_id, dept_id, salary) Use a CTE with window functions to return top 2 highest-paid employees in each department.
WITH highest_paid AS (
	SELECT dept_id, DISTINCT salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS r
	FROM employees
	) SELECT dept_id, salary FROM highest_paid WHERE r >= 2;

-- Q8. From table transactions(user_id, txn_date, amount) Use a CTE to calculate running total of amount per user, ordered by transaction date.
-- I know the logic behind running total it is same as calculation of cumulative frequency in statistics but I forgot the syntax behind implementing this logic using SQL 

--🔹 LEVEL 5 — Recursive & Advanced CTEs (Very Hard)
-- Q9. From table employees(emp_id, emp_name, manager_id) Use a recursive CTE to return the complete reporting hierarchy for each employee.
WITH t AS (
	SELECT e.emp_name AS Employee, m.emp_name AS Manager 
	FROM employeees e
	JOIN employees m 
	ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id
	) SELECT Employee, Manager FROM t;

-- Q10. From table logs(user_id, log_date) Use a CTE to find users who logged in for at least 5 consecutive days.
WITH t AS (
	SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS logged_in FROM logs
	GROUP BY user_id
	HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT log_date) = (
		SELECT HAVING COUNT(log_date)
		FROM logs 
		) t2
	) SELECT user_id FROM t WHERE loggged_in >= 5;

--🔹 BONUS — Data Engineering Level
-- Q11. From table sales(order_date, product_id, amount)
-- Use multiple CTEs to:
--Calculate monthly sales per product
--Calculate month-over-month growth
--Return products where growth is negative in any month
WITH monthlySales AS (
	SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR|MONTH FROM order_date) AS YYYY-MM, product_id, SUM(amount) AS total_sales 
	FROM sales 
	GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR|MONTH FROM order_date), product_id
	) WITH monthlyGrowth AS (
		SELECT YYYY-MM, product_id, total_sales, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY YYYY-MM ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM YYYY-MM) ASC) AS rn
		FROM monthlySales 
		) SELECT product_id 
		FROM monthlyGrowth 
		WHERE total_sales < (
			SELECT total_sales 
			FROM monthlyGrowth
			) AND rn > 2 AND rn = rn-1;
